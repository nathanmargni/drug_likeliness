# Drugability - Machine Learning Study

Here we deposit the code associated with the article *Minimal-uncertainty prediction of general drug-likeness based on Bayesian neural networks*
by Wiktor Beker, Agnieszka Wo≈Ços and Bartosz A. Grzybowski.

## Prerequisites

Before start, please make sure to have installed following packages (version used in this particular project indicated in parentheses):

* [RdKit](http://www.rdkit.org/) (version  2017.09.1)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) (version 2.2.4 with TensorFlow backend)
* [Keras Deep Learning on Graphs](https://vermamachinelearning.github.io/keras-deep-graph-learning/)
* [Sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org) (version 0.21.2)
* [Imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org) (version 0.4.3)
* [Mol2Vec](https://mol2vec.readthedocs.io) (version 0.1)
* [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) (version 5.2)

## Code organisation

The general idea was to separate common steps in machine learning experiments (vectorisation, model training and testing) into logical components and to control the configuration of ML experiment with YAML files, making room for non-standard procedures (that is such not already implemented in Sklearn).
As suggested by name, ```data_preprocess.py``` contains functions responsible for data loading and preprocess, whereas ```models.py``` collects functions constructing a model according to a given config. 
The ```make_experiment.py``` script governs the overall workflow according to a given YAML config file (see ```python make_experiment.py -h``` and examples provided below).

PU-learning scripts are placed in separate directory (```scripts/pu_fuselier.py``` for the Fuselier method and ```scripts/pu_iteration.py``` for the Liu approach) together with some additional tools.

### Configuration file

In general, configuration file is comprised of three parts: ```loader_config```, ```model_params``` and ```cross_validation``` (in some cases additional ```vectorizer_config``` part may be passed). The names are meant to be self-explanatory; see ```config_files/``` for examples.

In ```loader_config```, position ```data_balance``` controls data balancing:
* ```weights``` computes sample weight according to the size of each class,
* ```random``` selects random subset of the majority class (of the same size as the minority class),
* ```cut``` selects first part of the majority class (of the same size as the minority class).

## Examples
It is assumed to work in this directory. Create directory for experiment data.
```
mkdir experiments
```
### RdKit and Mol2Vec vectorization

For RdKit and Mol2Vec representations, the data has to be vectorized first (the names used below correspond to paths included in the config files).
Note that with Mol2Vec, you should provide path to pickle with Mol2Vec model. An example obtained according to the [instruction](https://mol2vec.readthedocs.io) (trained with ~20M compounds from ZINC and parameters: radius 1, UNK to replace all identifiers that appear less than 4 times, skip-gram and window size of 10 and resulting in 300 dimensional embeddings) is present in `models/model_300dim.pkl`.

```
python scripts/vectorize.py --output_core data/drugs_approved_rdkit --descriptor rdkit  data/drugs_approved.smiles
python scripts/vectorize.py --output_core data/drugs_approved_m2v --descriptor mol2vec --mol2vec_model_pkl models/model_300dim.pkl  data/drugs_approved.smiles
python scripts/vectorize.py --output_core data/zinc15_nondrugs_sample_rdkit --descriptor rdkit  data/zinc15_nondrugs_sample.smiles
python scripts/vectorize.py --output_core data/zinc15_nondrugs_sample_m2v --descriptor mol2vec --mol2vec_model_pkl models/model_300dim.pkl  data/zinc15_nondrugs_sample.smiles
```

Generated files ```*mu.npz, *std.npz``` and ```*idx.npz``` contains data for normalization step (mean, standard deviation and non-zero indices in the original vector, respectively). 
Note that in the paper those values were calculated for combined drug+nondrug dataset. Here, for the sake of clarity, we put ```zinc_nondrugs``` normalization parameters as an example.

### Sample perceptrons
#### RdKit with 5-fold cross-validation
```
python make_experiment.py --config config_files/rdkit_ae_zinc.yaml --validation_mode 5cv_test --output_core experiments/rdkit_ae_zinc
```
#### Bayesian NN on RdKit with 5-fold cross-validation
```
python make_experiment.py --config config_files/rdkit_ae_zinc_bayesian.yaml --validation_mode 5cv_test --output_core experiments/rdkit_ae_zinc_bayesian
```
### PU-learning example
```
python pu_fuselier.py --output_core experiments/fuselier_zinc_rdkit --config config_files/rdkit_ae_zinc_weights.yaml 
python pu_iteration.py --output_core experiments/liu_zinc_rdkit --config config_files/rdkit_ae_zinc_weights.yaml 
```
### Multi-task learning example
Vectorize clintox:
```
python scripts/extract_labels_from_csv.py --output data/clintox_labels.npz --output_smiles data/clintox.smiles --input data/clintox_cleaned.csv
python scripts/vectorize.py --output_core data/clintox_m2v --descriptor mol2vec --mol2vec_model_pkl MOL2VEC_MODEL_PKL  data/clintox.smiles
```
Run experiment
```
python make_experiment.py --config config_files/clintox_multitask.yaml --validation_mode 5cv_test --output_core experiments/clintox_mutlitask
```
### Balanced Random Forest example 
Assuming clintox is vectorized (as above).
```
python scripts/simple_rf.py --labels data/clintox_labels.npz --vectors data/clintox_m2v.npz --names data/clintox_cleaned.csv --brf
```

## Closing remarks
This repository was created as a part of scientific research rather than a standalone project. Due to tight schedule, it's quite 'sketchy'. I hope that with incoming projects I manage to transform it into a flexible framework for ML experiments with a possibility to have a lower-level control over each step (eg. user-defined splitting of the data). 

### ToDo
* test whether examples work correctly (ASAP)
* unify Keras and Sklearn APIs in ```make_experiment.py```
